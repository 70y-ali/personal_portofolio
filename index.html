            <p>I am currently a graduate student at the Changwon National University’s Department of Computer Engineering. 
                My research interests are biological data classification utilizing machine learning and deep learning. 
            </p>
            <p><u><b>Area of interest:</b></u> Machine learning and deep learning</p>
            
            <h5>Experience</h5>
            <i>Research student</i> <br>
            <a class='position' href="https://www.changwon.ac.kr"><u>Changwon National University</u></a>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Mar 2021 - Present</small>
            <p>
                As a full-time research student, I studied biological data identification and classification analysis. 
                In doing so, the seed coat patterns were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in 
                collaboration with the Departments of Biology & Microbiology and Computer Engineering, and I was identified and classified. 
                The task was completed by collecting data from several publications and then preprocessing the images. 
                In addition, I did two main tasks.These include seed coat pattern image categorization and new groups based on seed coat pattern images. 
                First, I defined the seed coat pattern and classified it using the popular Deep Learning network. 
                Second, new grouping was conducted using unsupervised machine learning on the preprocessed images.

            <p>
                I worked as a front-end developer at DDISH LLC, a subsidiary of MCS Group, a large Mongolian group. 
                During this time, our company upgraded its previously used Call Center system. 
                The following are included: JavaScript (ReactJS), HTML, CSS, and Material UI. 
            </p>

            <i>Software Engineer</i> <br>

            <p>
                When I first started as a software developer at the company, the KPI of call center system operators was handled manually.
                 Therefore, work was done to design a KPI automation module for the call center system. 
                 PHP Symfony Framework, advanced database was used as technologies. 
                I was challenged by the unknown and new technologies while working at the organization.

            <p>
                My internship taught me basic concepts of natural language processing (NLP) and found between word similarity
                 and distance-based cosine similarity using Java.
